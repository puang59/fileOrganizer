4. Sit back and watch as File Organizer does its magic!

## Grouping Methods

File Organizer can group files in the following ways:

- By file type: Organizes files into subfolders based on their file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.pdf`, etc.).
- By date: Organizes files into subfolders based on the date they were last modified (e.g., `2022-01-01`, `2022-01-02`, etc.).
- By category: Allows you to specify a list of categories and move files that match each category to a corresponding subfolder (e.g., `Music`, `Photos`, etc.).

## Customization

File Organizer can be easily customized to suit your specific needs. The script is well-commented and easy to understand, even for beginner Python programmers. You can modify the source code to add new grouping methods or customize the existing ones. You can also change the default source and destination directories, as well as the categories for the category grouping method.
